# HarvardX Capstone Project – AI Program Audit in Ontario Colleges

This repository contains the Capstone project for the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To quantify the proportion of AI-related programs offered across Ontario’s 24 public colleges using government-issued CIP-coded program data. This project focuses on the “Programs” (P) dimension of the broader PLANET-X AI-readiness framework, which supports a doctoral dissertation on AI integration in higher education.
